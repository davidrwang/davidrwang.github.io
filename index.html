		<h2> 
		<div>
				<p id="description">
					"If we took names off resumes and let the candidates' qualifications speak for themselves, a diverse team will emerge naturally. I've long felt that way. And my team is very diverse, I might add." - Terry Howard
					<br>
					<br>
					Nameless Resumes allows employers to remove the names from any resume at the click of a button. Removing all bias and allowing employers to focus solely on a candidate's qualifications which is beneficial to both parties.
